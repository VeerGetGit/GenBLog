# 📝 AI-Based SEO Blog Generation Tool (Task 2)

## 📌 Overview

The AI-Based SEO Blog Generation Tool is an automated application that generates SEO-optimized blog posts for e-commerce products.  
The system scrapes product names, generates SEO-friendly keywords using the Groq API (openai-gpt-oss-120B), creates a 150–200 word blog, and publishes it on a self-hosted website.

This tool significantly reduces manual effort in content creation and enables rapid generation of SEO blogs.
